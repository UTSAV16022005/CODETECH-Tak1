# OVERVIEW 

**Objective:**  
Create a Python program that functions as a basic calculator. The program should:
- Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
- Allow the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Perform the selected operation.
- Display the result to the user.

### **Solution Overview:**

We'll develop a console-based calculator that:
1. **Inputs:** Accepts two numerical inputs from the user.
2. **Operation Selection:** Presents a menu for the user to select an arithmetic operation.
3. **Computation:** Performs the chosen operation.
4. **Output:** Displays the result to the user.
5. **Error Handling:** Includes validation for numerical inputs and handles division by zero gracefully.

6. ### **Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Functions:**
   - `get_number(prompt)`: Continuously prompts the user for input until a valid floating-point number is entered.

2. **Operation Selection:**
   - Displays a menu of operations.
   - `get_operation()`: Ensures that the user selects a valid operation (1, 2, 3, or 4).

3. **Computation:**
   - Based on the user's choice, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
   - Includes a check to prevent division by zero, displaying an error message if attempted.

4. **Output:**
   - Displays the result in a readable format, showing the operation performed and the outcome.

### **Running the Program:**

1. **Save the Code:**
   - Save the above code in a file named `simple_calculator.py`.

2. **Execute the Program:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `simple_calculator.py`.
   - Run the program using the command:
     ```
     python simple_calculator.py
     ```

3. **Usage:**
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to enter numbers and select the desired operation.
   - The result will be displayed after performing the calculation.

4. **Output:**
   Outputs with all operations
